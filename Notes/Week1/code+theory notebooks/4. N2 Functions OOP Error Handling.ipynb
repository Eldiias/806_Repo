    "\n",

    "> 1. In a medium bowl, beat eggs until no whites remain, then season with salt, pepper, and a pinch red pepper flakes.\n",
    "> 2. In a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Pour in eggs and tilt pan so eggs fully cover the entire pan. As eggs start to set, use a rubber spatula to drag cooked edges into center of pan. Tilt pan to let uncooked egg fall to the edge of the pan. \n",
    "> 3. Once the bottom is set, but top is still a little wet, sprinkle cheese and chives on one half of omelet. Fold other side over cheese and slide omelet onto a plate.   \n",

    "* Language can be fully functional language, eg: Lisp, Haskell, Visual Basic, etc.\n",
    "* You have a fixed number of variables and you apply different operations to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And OOP is usefil if:\n",
    "* Language you are using supports OOP, eg: Java, JavaScript, C++, PHP, etc.\n",
    "* You have a fixed number of operations and you apply them on a different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, functional programming is great when you are building something that does not mimic the real world, while OOP is great when you are building something that may reflect the real world. For example, you might build a utility library to automize routine processes such as data cleaning. You are going to work with lots of different datasets and the approaches you are going to implement won't vary that much. Inputs are exactly the same - integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. So, you go for Functional Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand you could create a library for your company that operates with all the datapoints you handle. For instance, you could have the following objects - Products, Clients, Branches, and a bunch of operations made on this growing set of objects. At the same time, we don't care about the set of objects - they will inherit all the operations predefined for each of them. But, when it comes to operations - additional operation will lead to new database."
